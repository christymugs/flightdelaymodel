# Flight Delay Prediction

This repository contains code for analyzing and predicting flight delays using historical flight data from 2009 to 2018.

## Overview

The project involves the following tasks:

1. **Data Collection**: The flight delay datasets from 2009 to 2018 are collected from [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018).

2. **Data Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Average arrival delay by origin and destination airports.
   - Correlation matrix of numeric features.
   - Average delay by month.

3. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - Predicting flight delays based on air time and distance using a neural network.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries
- Kaggle Dataset

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the required libraries:

Copy code
Download the datasets from Kaggle and place them in a folder named flight_years in the root directory of the project.

## Usage

Run the flight_delay_prediction.py script to:

Visualize average arrival delays by origin and destination airports.
Display a correlation matrix of numeric features.
Show the average delay by month.
Train a neural network model to predict flight delays based on air time and distance.
Perform real-time predictions for flight delays.
